abstract={Fly ash is a by-product almost found in coal power plants; it is available worldwide. According to the hazardous impacts of cement on the environment, fly ash is known to be a suitable replacement for cement in concrete. A lot of carbon dioxide (CO2) is released during cement manufacturing. The investigations estimate that about 8 – 10% of the total CO2 emissions are maintained by cement production. Since fly ash has nearly the same chemical compounds as cement, it can be utilized as a suitable alternative to cement in concrete (green concrete). The current study analyzes the effect of the quantity of the two main components of fly ash, CaO, and SiO2, on the compressive strength of concrete modified with different fly ash content for various mix proportions. For this purpose, various concrete samples modified with fly ash were collected from the literature (236 datasets), analyzed, and modeled using four different models; Full-quadratic (FQ), Nonlinear regression (NLR), Multi-linear regression (MLR), and Artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the compressive strength of concrete with different geometry and size of the specimens. The accuracy of the models was evaluated using correlation coefficient (R2), Mean absolute error (MAE), Root mean squared error (RMSE), Scatter Index (SI), a-20 index, and Objective function (OBJ). According to the modeling results, increasing SiO2 (%) increased the compressive strength, while increasing CaO (%) increased compressive strength only when the cement replacement with fly ash was between 52 and –100%. Based on R2, RMSE, and MAE, the ANN model was the most effective and accurate on predicting the compressive strength of concrete in different strength ranges. According to the sensitivity analysis, curing time is the most critical characteristic for predicting the compression strength of concrete using this database. The primary objective of this work is to explore and evaluate various machine-learning models for predicting compressive resistance. The study emphasizes these models' development, comparison, and performance assessment, highlighting their potential to predict compressive strength accurately. The research primarily uses machine learning, leveraging algorithms and techniques to build predictive models. The focus is on harnessing the power of data-driven approaches to improve the accuracy and reliability of compressive strength predictions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In recent years, textile reinforcement has been widely researched and used in reinforced concrete beams, slabs, and thin plates. However, the design for bending is completely different from that of the shear case. The use of textile carbon yarns in place of or in addition to traditional steel stirrups to reinforce the shear has been investigated. Eight beams with dimensions of 200 mm × 300 mm × 1500 mm were used in this investigation. These beams were tested in shear under four load points. Two specimens were used with and without steel stirrups as reference specimens, while the other six beams used textile carbon yarns instead of steel stirrups. The variables of this study were the length of overlap, which was 30%, 60%, and 100%, the spacing was 90 mm and 130 mm, while inclination was 45° and 90°, and bonding with or without steel fibers. The results showed that using 100% overlap length, 90 mm spacing, a 45° angle, and adding steel fibers increased the shear capacity, increased the deflection, and made the cracking behavior better. © 2022},

abstract={The use of nano-materials to improve the engineering properties of different types of concrete composites including geopolymer concrete (GPC) has recently gained popularity. Numerous programs have been executed to investigate the mechanical properties of GPC. In general, compressive strength (CS) is an essential mechanical indicator for judging the quality of concrete. Traditional test methods for determining the CS of GPC are expensive, time-consuming and limiting due to the complicated interplay of a wide variety of mixing proportions and curing regimes. Therefore, in this study, artificial neural network (ANN), multi-expression programming, full quadratic, linear regression and M5P-tree machine learning techniques were used to predict the CS of GPC. In this instance, around 207 tested CS values were extracted from the literature and studied to promote the models. During the process of modeling, eleven effective variables were utilized as input model parameters, and one variable was utilized as an output. Four statistical indicators were used to judge how well the models worked, and the sensitivity analysis was carried out. According to the results, the ANN model calculated the CS of GPC with greater precision than the other models. On the other hand, the ratio of alkaline solution to the binder, molarity, NaOH content, curing temperature and concrete age have substantial effects on the CS of GPC. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Shear damage is a catastrophic failure in the design of reinforced concrete structural elements. To prevent it, the effect of aluminum wastes on reinforced concrete shear beams was investigated in this study. There is a gap in the scientific field on the expanding concrete with aluminium waste, and no research has been done on the utilizing of aluminum waste to produce expandable concrete. Moreover, there is a gap in expandable concrete usage with aluminum waste reinforcing, which is crucial for engineering applications especially beams, slabs and columns. For this purpose, experimental investigations were performed on a total of 12 Reinforced Concrete Beams (RCB) with different aluminum waste ratio (0, 1, 2 and 3 vol.%) and different shear reinforcement spacing (270, 200 and 160 mm). The depth span ratio was chosen as 1.6, 2.0 and 2.7. RCB was simply supported on the loading frame and subjected to four-points bending. As a result of experimental tests for each sample, the maximum load, stiffness, ductility and energy dissipation capacity were calculated. It was observed that the load capacity of the Al refuse combined RCBs raises as the vacancy of the stirrup reinforcement reductions compared with reference RCBs. Furthermore, it was found that the load capacity of the RCBs reduced as the Al refuse quantity in the concrete mixture was increased from 0% to 3%. However, it was found that the decrease in load capacity for 1 vol.% aluminum waste could be tolerated. For this reason, it can be stated that aluminum waste (AW) in reinforced concrete shear beams will contribute to the beam up to 1%. © 2023 The Authors},

abstract={The disposal of waste from coal plants and waste glass (WG) is causing significant environmental problems all around the planet. Currently, the amount of discarding of these wastes is increased. One possible option is to utilize fly ash (FA) from coal plants as a partial substitute for the cement and EG as a fractional substitute for sand in concrete, respectively. Besides, fibers can improve the strength and durability of concrete; explicitly speaking, using coconut fibers (CFs) is in trend due to their highest toughness among natural fibers making it suitable material as fiber reinforcement in concrete. This research studies the concrete behavior with 15% FA as a partial substitute of cement with 2% CFs and waste beverage glass as sand at various replacement levels (14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, and 20%). Mechanical and durability characteristics of concrete were assessed, such as compression strength, water absorption, flexural strength, density, workability, and water absorption. The current study results show that adding FA, CFs, and WG improved microstructure quality at 16% replacement of sand. The study showed that the M4 mix has enhanced the properties of concrete samples as compressive and flexural strength was improved to 47.2 and 6.2 MPa and improved apparent density by 20%. Adding more WGP than the optimal proportion (16%) led to detrimental effects on void ratio, permeability, and water absorption. Therefore, 16% of sand with WG and 15% of FA with cement can be substituted with 2% CFs to develop sustainable concrete. © 2022 International Federation for Structural Concrete.},

abstract={Construction material sustainability and waste reuse have emerged as significant environmental issues. Concrete is widely used in the building and engineering fields. Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC), which has remarkably high mechanical properties, has become one of the most common concrete varieties in recent years. As a result, substantial amounts of Portland cement (PC) are frequently used, raising the initial cost of UHPC and restricting its broad use in structural applications. A significant amount of CO2 is produced and a large amount of natural resources are consumed in its production. To make UHPC production more eco-friendly and economically viable, it is advised that the PC in concrete preparations be replaced with different additives and that the recycled aggregates from various sources be substituted for natural aggregates. This research aims to develop an environmentally friendly and cost-effective UHPC by using glass waste (GW) of various sizes as an alternative to PC with replacement ratios of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% utilizing glass powder (GP). Fine aggregate “sand (S)” is also replaced by glass particles (G) with replacement ratios of 0%, 50%, and 100%. To accomplish this, 18 mixes, separated into three groups, are made and examined experimentally. Slump flow, mechanical properties, water permeability, and microstructural characteristics are all studied. According to the results, increasing the S replacement ratio with G improved workability. Furthermore, the ideal replacement ratios for replacing PC with GP and S with G to achieve high mechanical properties were 20% and 0%, respectively. Increasing the replacement rate of GP in place of PC at a fixed ratio of G to S resulted in a significant decrease in water permeability values. Finally, a microstructural analysis confirms the experimental findings. In addition, PC100-S100 was the best mix compared to PC100-S50 G50 and PC100-G100. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Due to its significant deficiencies such as low permeability, low bearing and shear strength, and excessive compressibility, soft soil is one of the most problematic types of soil in civil engineering and soil stabilization can be considered a suitable technique for pavements. This study investigates the use of ground granulated blast slag (GGBS) and cement kiln dust (CKD) as stabilizers for soft soil. Thus, this study involves two optimization stages; in the first stage, GGBS was incorporated into 0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, and 12% by the weight of cement to obtain the optimal percentage, which was 6%. Then, the optimal GGBS was blended with CKD in a binary system at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% by the dry weight of the soil. The testing program used in this paper was Atterberg limits with compaction parameters to investigate the physical properties and unconfined compressive strength (USC) at 7 and 28 days to examine the mechanical characteristics. In addition, the microstructures of the soil specimens were tested at 7 and 28 days using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The findings reveal that the binary system enhanced the physical and mechanical properties of the soft soil. The optimum binder achieved in this study was 6% (25% GGBS and 75% CKD), which generates an increase in strength of about 3.3 times in 7 days, and of 5.5 times in 28 days in comparison to the untreated soil. The enhancement was attributed to the formation of the hydration products as approved by SEM. Consequently, in the case of soft subgrade soils, this technique can increase the pavement’s bearing capacity and performance. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Certain disadvantages could have appeared while using hot mix asphalt (HMA), such as the release of unhealthy gases into the environment (environmental issues), difficulty in sustaining the temperature over long distances (logistical issues), and consuming a sufficient amount of energy while preparing and laying down (practical and economic issues). To overcome the aforementioned issues, this study aimed to develop rapid-curing emulsified asphalt cold mixes (EACM) comprising a cementitious filler made from industrial by-product materials. Paper sludge ash (PSA) is used as an active filler for application in the EACM rather than conventional mineral filler. Additionally, to maximize the effect of PSA’s hydraulic activity, incinerated sewage ash (ISA) is utilized as an activator at a concentration of 0%–4% by mass of the aggregates. The results demonstrate that the use of waste PSA significantly improves the indirect tensile stiffness modulus (ITSM) by around 10 times more after 2 days than the traditional emulsified asphalt cold mixes. In addition, the improvement in ITSM was around 30% and 65% for 6%PSA+1%ISA and 6%PSA+4%ISA mixes, respectively. Furthermore, the rutting for the 6%PSA+1%ISA and 6%PSA+4%ISA mixes decreased to around 19% and 11% in comparison to the traditional 131-pen HMA. The formation of hydration products and rapid demulsification of asphalt emulsion, which results in binding within the mixtures, are responsible for the increased ITSM and rutting resistance. As a result, environmental issues are minimized, and energy preservation may be maintained. Copyright © 2023 Dulaimi, Qaidi, Al-Busaltan, Milad, Sadique, Kadhim, Al-Khafaji and Sabri Sabri.},

abstract={In the present era of architecture, different cross-sectional shapes of structural concrete elements have been utilized. However, this change in shape has a significant effect on load-carrying capacity. To restore this, the use of column confinements with elliptical sections has gained attention. This paper aim to investigate the effect of elliptical shape sections of confined concrete reinforced with Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) and steel tube on axial load-carrying capacity. This study is achieved using following tools Finite Element (FE) in Abaqus and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) modeling. The study involved a 500-mm-high column with three sets of aspect ratios: 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0. In each aspect ratio, three different layers of CFRP were used, i.e.,.167,.334, and.501-mm. Analytical results showed that with the increase in aspect ratio from 1 to 2, there is a decrease in ultimate axial load of about 23.2% on average. In addition, the combined confining pressure of steel tube and CFRP increases with a decrease in dilation angle as the number of CFRP layers increases. The failure mode for the column with a large aspect ratio is local buckling at its mid-height along the minor axis. The result showed a good correlation between FE and experimental results of ultimate stress and strains, with a mean squared error of 2.27 and.001, respectively. Moreover, ANN and analytical models showed a delightful correlation of R2 of.97 for stress models and.88 for strain models, respectively. The elliptical concrete section of the column confined with steel tubes can be adopted for a new architectural type of construction; however, with more than three aspect ratios, the wrapping of the section with CFRP jackets is highly recommended.

abstract={In this study, PET plastic waste, which is a type of polymer commonly used in the manufacture of plastic bottles, has been incorporated into concrete by partially replacing the natural fine aggregate. An experimental study was conducted by casting and testing 90 concrete cylinders and 54 concrete cubes. A concrete mixture was designed in which the natural fine aggregate was substituted partially with PET plastic waste (PW) at a ratio of 0%, 25%, and 50%, with various w/c ratios of.40,.45, and.55. Physical, mechanical, and durability properties were assessed. The downside of the test results show degradation in each of the following characteristics: slump, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water absorption, and porosity. The degradation of these characteristics increased with the increase in the volume of plastic aggregate (PA) and the w/c ratio. While the positive side of the results showed that with the increase of the PA volume and the w/c ratio, the fresh and dry densities decreased further, and by using 50% PET, the dry density became below 2000 kg/m3. Therefore, it is classified as lightweight concrete. Moreover, the fracture of concrete changed from brittle to more ductile compared to control concrete. Also, the thermal conductivity decreased significantly (11%–47%), and by using 50% of PET, the thermal conductivity became less than.71 W/mK, and accordingly, classified as a bearing insulator.

abstract={Concrete use as a building component is already associated with the global construction sector. Since extensive research on concrete has been conducted for many years, there is a growing interest among researchers to conduct studies to increase the capacity of concrete for use in the building sector. Lightweight foamed concrete is one of the cutting-edge solutions developed for lighter and more sustainable buildings. Although this type of concrete has several benefits, its strength is still viewed as being inferior to that of regular concrete. By limiting the LFC with a crisscross fiberglass strip, the authors of this work will demonstrate improvements in LFC behaviour in terms of its compressive strength (CFS). To examine its improvements, 3 different LFC densities were cast and contained with 1 to 3 layers of 160 g/m2 CFS. For this test, the cement-to-sand ratio was fixed at 1.1:5, and the water content was set at 0.45. The results revealed that the compressive strength of LFC confined with 1 to 3 layers of CFS increased by 153%, 97% and 102% were acquired for 600, 1100 and 1600 kg/m3 densities respectively. This demonstrates that the number of layers used affects how positively the confinement of CFS affects the compressive behaviour of LFC. © 2023, Penerbit Akademia Baru. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed an increase in the quantity of waste glass (WG) across the globe. Replacing the fine aggregate with WG is one of the steps toward preserving the natural resources of the environment and creating low-cost concrete. The present study is concerned with replacing fine aggregates with glass powder (GP) at (0%, 15%, 30%, and 50%). It has studied the fresh and hardened properties (compressive strength, tensile strength, hardened density, and slump) for all the mentioned percent replacements. The findings have shown that all mixtures containing GP gave acceptable slump results within the design limits (2–5 cm) according to ACI standard 211.1. It has been observed that increasing the proportion of GP led to a decrease in the weight of concrete. Lastly, replacing GP with sand by 30% has led to an increase in the compressive strength by about 2.4% and 12.45%, and the tensile strength by about 2.5% and 26.54% at 7- and 28-d, respectively in comparison to normal concrete. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

abstract={The demand for lightweight building materials that are easy to work with, self-compacting, and environmentally friendly has been acknowledged by the construction industry globally. Given this demand, it has been discovered that a recent innovative material, lightweight foamed concrete (LFC), may be able to reduce the weight of ordinary concrete. Besides, utilizing LFC with the addition of natural fibres is seen as a great effort to assist sustainability. Corrosion of reinforcing steel, which affects the behaviour and longevity of concrete buildings, is one of the most significant challenges in the construction of reinforced LFC. Therefore, the focus of this work is on identifying the possible application of Musa Acuminate fibre (MAF) in LFC. The intention of this study is to ascertain the durability characteristics of LFC with MAF. The cast has a low density of 550 kg/m3. We'll employ several volume fractions of MAF that are 0.15%, 0.30%, 0.45%, and 0.60%. The ability to absorb water, porosity, drying shrinkage and ultrasonic pulse velocity are the four criteria that will be evaluated. For the purpose of creating the necessary density of LFC, the protein-based foaming agent Noraite PA-1 was used. A constant water-to-cement ratio of 0.45 and a constant cement-to-sand ratio of 1.5 were used to get comparable results. The findings showed that for all of the durability attributes taken into account in this research, an increase of 0.45% MAF produced the best results. This resulted from the MAF and LFC cementitious composite's better bonding performance. Additionally, the fibres served as an anti-micro crack, preventing LFC cracks. © 2023, Penerbit Akademia Baru.

abstract={The desire to make the concrete industry more environmentally friendly has existed for a long time. Geopolymer concrete, which uses industrial or agricultural by-product ashes as the primary source of binder materials instead of Portland cement, has emerged as a viable building material due to the environmental concerns associated with cement production. One of the most important mechanical parameters for all types of concrete composites, including geopolymer concrete, is compressive strength. This parameter is influenced by a variety of factors, including the alkaline solution to binder ratio, the type and amount of binder, the chemical composition of the binder materials, the amount of aggregate present, the type and amount of alkaline solutions, the ratio of alkaline liquid to binder materials, the curing regime, and the age of the specimens. In this context, a detailed systematic assessment was conducted to demonstrate the effect of these various parameters on the compressive strength of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete (FA-GPC). In addition, multi-scale models such as artificial neural networks, M5P-tree, linear regression, and multi-logistic regression models were developed to predict the compressive strength of FA-GPC composites. Results show that the curing temperature (between 60 °C to 90 °C), sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide ratio (between 1.5 to 2.5), and the alkaline solution to the binder ratio (between 0.35 to 0.5) are those parameters that govern the compressive strength of the FA-GPC. Furthermore, based on the statistical assessment tools, the ANN model has better performance for predicting the compressive strength of FA-GPC than the other developed models as it has the highest value of the coefficient of determination (0.96), lower values of the root mean squared error (3.33), mean absolute error (2.58), objective function value (2.91), and scatter index (0.109). © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={Using soft computing methods could be of great interest in predicting the compressive strength of Ultra-High-Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC). Therefore, this study developed four soft computing techniques. The models are the Linear- relationship (LR), pure quadratic, M5P-tree (M5P), and artificial neural network (ANN). The models were trained and developed using 306 datasets comprising 11 input parameters, including the curing temperature (T), the water-to-cement ratio (w/c), silica fume (SF), cement content (C), fiber content (Fb), water (W), sand content (S), superplasticizer (SP), fiber aspect ratio (AR) and curing time (t). Experimental results were used and compared to the model performances to validate the developed models. The models were developed based on 192 training datasets, and the model's accuracy was checked using 41 testing datasets; the model's outcomes were validated using 32 experimental datasets. The results show a high prediction accuracy of the compressive strength of UHPFRC using ANN models.

abstract={The application of three-dimensional printed (3DP) technology is expected to lead to the industrial revolution 4.0, disrupting the economy and providing design customization and adaptation. The construction sector is rapidly catching up to this modern technology with the production of a 3D printer for concrete to provide a healthy work environment, economic independence, and architectural freedom. Despite the fact that 3DP concrete technology has progressed significantly in recent decades, there is an urgent need to develop appropriate 3DP materials that improve performance while reducing material consumption, which is critical for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Geopolymers (GPs) have been found to be a promising alternative to cement-based materials for 3DP in the construction industry, which could help make it more environmentally friendly. This article comprehensively reviews the printing process, performance requirements, advantages, disadvantages, and common 3DP concrete technologies. This article also provides in-depth studies on the behaviors and characteristics of GP composites utilized in 3DP production, such as mix design, rheology, and mechanical characteristics. Besides, study developments are moving towards a comprehensive understanding of the environmental footprints and economic benefits of 3DP concrete for building applications utilizing GPs as suitable concrete materials for the emerging environmentally friendly robust concrete compound for digital constructions today. This review article also highlights knowledge gaps or potential challenges that must be overcome to progress GP composites for 3DP, as well as future study opportunities based on prior research and existing challenges. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The impact of three-shaped steel fibres (straight, hooked end, and corrugated) with varying steel fibre (SF) contents (0.75 %, 1.5 %, and 2.5 % by volume fraction) on the fresh and mechanical characteristics of ultra-high-performance concrete was investigated in this investigation. The characteristics concerned included flowability, compressive strength, and modulus of rupture. The findings showed that using deformed fibres and increasing the fibre volume could gradually reduce the flowability of ultra-high-performance concrete. It also had a substantial impact on the compressive strength and modulus of rupture of ultra-high-performance concrete. At 28-d, its compressive strength and modulus of rupture were greater than 155 and 37 MPa, respectively, with the introduction of 2.5 % straight SFs. Moreover, the compressive strength increased by 50 % and 65 % for concrete comprising 2.5 % hooked end fibre and corrugated fibre, respectively, when compared to concrete with the same volume of straight ﬁbre. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={ultrahigh-performance concrete is a type of advanced concrete that can improve the resilience and durability of concrete structures. The utilization of available supplementary cementitious materials is a critical step in saving energy and materials, as well as lowering the cost of concrete. This research investigated the impact of sand grain size distribution, supplementary cementitious materials, and curing regimes (CRs) on the compressive strength of ultrahigh-performance concrete. The findings showed that a 90-d strength of 175 MPa could be obtained with a microsilica volume of 5 % and without heat-curing. The highest strength was obtained after curing for 48 h at 60 °C, followed by 72 h at 90 °C. Moreover, when compared to natural grain size distribution sand, the usage of finer sand enhances compressive strength. When microsilica is added, however, this impact is minimized. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The present research investigates the influence of constituent material ratio on the fresh characteristics and compressive and flexural strengths of ultrahigh-performance concrete. In this regard, the influence of superplasticiser content of 1%, 1.3%, and 1.5%, microsilica substitution values of 20%, 25%, and 30%, and three water-to-binder ratios of 0.20, 0.22, and 0.24 on squeeze flow (SqF) characteristics and compressive and flexural strengths were evaluated. The findings revealed that increasing the superplasticiser dose enhanced compressive strength by up to 12% while increasing the water-to-binder ratio lowered it by up to 14%. Moreover, by increasing the amount of binder and/or decreasing the amount of sand, the concrete skeleton structure was broken down, which lowered the compressive strength. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The goal of this research is to identify the impact of microsilica and polypropylene fibers (PF) on the mechanical characteristics of an ultra-high performance geopolymer concrete (UHP-GPC). The workability, compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, and splitting tensile strength of a total of 20 concrete mixtures were evaluated experimentally. To produce the mixtures, PF was utilized at four different volume fractions: 0 %, 0.75 %, 1.75 %, and 2.75 %. Moreover, five microsilica levels were employed in terms of the total mass of the binder: 0 %, 7.5 %, 15 %, 25 %, and 35 %. The findings showed that when 15 % microsilica was added to UHP-GPC, the mechanical characteristics were significantly degraded, but then enhanced when more than 15 % microsilica was added. Furthermore, PF contributes significantly to the mechanical characteristics of UHP-GPC and introducing 2.75 % PF minimizes a significant drop in the characteristics of UHP-GPC when 15 % microsilica is employed. ‎ © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is a cement-based composite used for new construction and/or the restoration of existing structures in order to extend their service life. It is a revolutionary composite material that can serve as a suitable substitute for concrete construction in hostile environments. After decades of research and development, a wide variety of commercial UHPC compositions have been created around the world to meet the expanding number of uses and demand for high-quality building materials. Although UHPC has significant advantages over conventional concrete, its application is limited due to restrictive design rules and high cost. Therefore, a careful review of the various properties of UHPC is necessary to offer key information for material testing criteria and methods and to broaden its practical uses. “Part I reviewed the developments, principles, and raw materials of the UHPFRC. Part II reviewed the hydration and microstructure of the UHPFRC. Part III reviewed the fresh and hardened properties of the UHPFRC. Part IV covers the durability properties, cost assessment, applications, and challenges of the UHPFRC. This Part V covers the mixture design, preparation, mixing, casting, and curing of the UHPFRC.” This review is anticipated to increase the fundamental understanding of UHPC and encourage additional study and applications of UHPC. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The impact of substantial amounts of plastic waste (PW) substituted fine aggregate (FA) on the mechanical characteristics of concrete under impact load (I.L) was studied experimentally-and-numerically. As fine aggregate substitutes, samples were made with 0%, 20%, 30%, and 40% PW. Six prisms of 100 mm width, 50 mm depth, and 400 mm length were loaded to failure in a drop-weight impact machine after 28 days by exposing them to 30 N of weight from a 400 mm height, while another three prisms of the same size and age were evaluated under static load(S.L). The load-displacement(L-D) and fracture energy(GF) of normal and concrete with PW prisms under S.L and I.L were investigated. A 3D finite element technique simulation was also carried out using LUSAS V.14 to investigate the impact of L-D behavior, and the predictions were confirmed by experimental findings. Despite reducing the fine aggregate amount, it was discovered that a proportionate increase of PW up to 20% can lead to improvements in bending load, impact tup, and inertial load. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is a type of cement-based composite for new construction and/or restoration of existing structures to increase service life. It is an innovative composite material that can be a suitable alternative to concrete structures exposed to aggressive conditions. After decades of research and development, a wide range of commercial UHPC compositions have been produced worldwide to cover a growing number of applications and a growing demand for high-quality construction materials. UHPC has significant advantages over regular concrete, but its use is limited due to limited design codes and prohibitive cost. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the durability characteristics of UHPC is essential to provide fundamental information for material testing requirements and procedures and expand its practical applications. Part I reviewed the developments, principles, and raw materials of the UHPFRC. Part II reviewed the hydration and microstructure of the UHPFRC. Part III reviewed the fresh and hardened properties of the UHPFRC. This Part IV covers the durability properties, cost assessment, applications, and challenges of the UHPFRC. Part V covers the mixture design, preparation, mixing, casting, and curing of the UHPFRC. This review is expected to advance the fundamental knowledge of UHPC and promote further research and applications of UHPC. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) refers to cement-based materials exhibiting a compressive strength higher than 150 MPa, high ductility, and excellent durability. Besides, over the last twenty years, remarkable advances have taken place in the research and application of Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC). Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the durability characteristics of UHPC is essential to provide fundamental information for material testing requirements and procedures and expand its practical applications. Part I reviewed the developments, principles, and raw materials of the UHPFRC. This Part II covers the hydration and microstructure of the UHPFRC. Part III covers the fresh and hardened properties of the UHPFRC. Part IV covers the durability properties, cost assessment, applications, and challenges of the UHPFRC. This review is expected to advance the fundamental knowledge of UHPC and promote further research and applications of UHPC. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Recently, Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) has offered notable advantages over other types of concrete. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the latest developments in Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC) is necessary to provide essential information for materials testing requirements and procedures and to expand its practical applications. The present work is a comprehensive four-part review of the UHPFRC. The current first part of the review focuses attention on the developments, principles, and raw materials of the UHPFRC. Part II covers the hydration and microstructure of the UHPFRC. Part III reviewed the fresh and hardened properties of the UHPFRC. Part IV covers the durability properties, cost assessment, applications, and challenges of the UHPFRC. This review is expected to advance the fundamental knowledge of UHPC and promote further research and applications of UHPC. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Due to the advantages and challenges specific to geopolymer concrete, especially the ultra-high-performance geopolymer concrete (UHP-GPC) ones, additional studies are warranted. This paper aims to improve the understanding of UHP-GPC by investigating its properties. This research investigates the influence of steel fiber and microsilica (also known as silica fume) on the mechanical characteristics of ultra-high performance geopolymer concrete (UHP-GPC). Three different volume fractions of steel fiber of 0%, 1%, 2%, and 3% and four microsilica volumes by the total mass of the binder of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 25% were utilized. The compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural behavior, and fracture energy are all investigated. Besides, the SEM analyses were performed to understand the mechanism of strength improvement based on the reaction products and micromorphology. The results show that by increasing the amount of microsilica, the amount of steel fiber can be decreased without changing the way UHP-GPC mechanical characteristics. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) refers to cement-based materials exhibiting a compressive strength higher than 150 MPa, high ductility, and excellent durability. Besides, over the last twenty years, remarkable advances have taken place in the research and application of Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC). Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of the durability characteristics of UHPC is essential to provide fundamental information for material testing requirements and procedures and expand its practical applications. Part I reviewed the developments, principles, and raw materials of the UHPFRC. Part II reviewed the hydration and microstructure of the UHPFRC. This Part III covers the fresh and hardened properties of the UHPFRC. Part IV covers the durability properties, cost assessment, applications, and challenges of the UHPFRC. Part V covers the mixture design, preparation, mixing, casting, and curing of the UHPFRC. This review is expected to advance the fundamental knowledge of UHPC and promote further research and applications of UHPC. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Ultra-high-performance geopolymer concrete (UHPGPC) was investigated in this paper using microsilica and granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS) comprising polypropylene fiber (PF) and steel fiber (SF). The first group of mixing ratios was used to develop a control mixture with maximum compressive strength for this purpose. In the second group, nine mixtures were used to evaluate the effect of the fibers on the compressive strength, split strength, flexural strength, and modulus of elasticity of UHPGPC. Furthermore, the SEM analyses were performed to understand the mechanism of strength improvement based on the reaction products and micromorphology. The results indicate that the presence of PF in samples containing SF enhances its mechanical properties. Moreover, the results indicate that replacing PF with SF reduces mechanical strength while increasing durability. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Utilization of waste materials in the treatment of challenging polluted soils is a cost-effective and environmentally responsible strategy, as it helps to reduce disposal issues created by diverse industrial wastes. The aim of this research is to utilize waste material Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) to enhance several engineering characteristics of polluted soil with crude oil. The engineering characteristics of clean and polluted soils with crude oil were investigated and compared to controls. Three percentages of crude oil 3%, 6%, and 9% were artificially mixed with clayey soils by weight. The effects of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag on the compaction properties (OMC and MDD) and shear strength characteristics (cohesion and angle of friction) of the soil were studied. Different percentages of GGBFS (12%, and 18%) by dry weight were utilized in mixtures of soil samples for different experiments. Ultimately, bases on the experimental results, it is summarized that the use of industrial wastes, i.e. GGBFS are affected in shear strength and compaction properties. Although, they have environment-friendly behavior for the construction project purpose. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In recent decades, researchers have begun to investigate innovative sustainable construction materials for the development of greener and more environmentally friendly infrastructures. The main purpose of this article is to investigate the possibility of employing date palm tree waste as a natural fiber alternative for conventional steel and polypropylene fibers (PPFs) in concrete. Date palm fibers are a common agricultural waste in Middle Eastern nations, particularly Saudi Arabia. As a result, this research examined the engineering properties of high-strength concrete using date palm fibers, as well as the performance of traditional steel and PPF concrete. The concrete samples were made using 0.0%, 0.20%, 0.60%, and 1.0% by volume of date palm, steel, and polypropylene fibers. Ten concrete mixtures were made in total. Compressive strength, flexural strength, splitting tensile strength, density, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), water absorption capability, and water permeability tests were performed on the fibrous-reinforced high-strength concrete. With a 1% proportion of date palm, steel, and polypropylene fibers, the splitting tensile strength improved by 17%, 43%, and 16%, respectively. By adding 1% fiber, flexural strength was increased by 60% to 85%, 67% to 165%, and 61% to 79%. In addition, date palm fibers outperformed steel and PPFs in terms of density, UPV, and water permeability. As a result, date palm fibers might potentially be employed in the present construction sector to improve the serviceability of structural elements. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={In this study, ground glass powder and crushed waste glass were used to replace coarse and fine aggregates. Within the scope of the study, fine aggregate (FA) and coarse aggregate (CA) were changed separately with proportions of 10%, 20%, 40%, and 50%. According to the mechanical test, including compression, splitting tensile, and flexural tests, the waste glass powder creates a better pozzolanic effect and increases the strength, while the glass particles tend to decrease the strength when they are swapped with aggregates. As observed in the splitting tensile test, noteworthy progress in the tensile strength of the concrete was achieved by 14%, while the waste glass used as a fractional replacement for the fine aggregate. In samples where glass particles were swapped with CA, the tensile strength tended to decrease. It was noticed that with the adding of waste glass at 10%, 20%, 40%, and 50% of FA swapped, the increase in flexural strength was 3.2%, 6.3%, 11.1%, and 4.8%, respectively, in amount to the reference one (6.3 MPa). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis consequences also confirm the strength consequences obtained from the experimental study. While it is seen that glass powder provides better bonding with cement with its pozzolanic effect and this has a positive effect on strength consequences, it is seen that voids are formed in the samples where large glass pieces are swapped with aggregate and this affects the strength negatively. Furthermore, simple equations using existing data in the literature and the consequences obtained from the current study were also developed to predict mechanical properties of the concrete with recycled glass for practical applications. Based on findings obtained from our study, 20% replacement for FA and CA with waste glass is recommended. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Portland cement (PC) is considered the most energy-intensive building material and contributes to around 10% of global warming. It exacerbates global warming and climate change, which have a harmful environmental impact. Efforts are being made to produce sustainable and green concrete as an alternative to PC concrete. As a result, developing a more sustainable strategy and eco-friendly materials to replace ordinary concrete has become critical. Many studies on geopolymer concrete, which has equal or even superior durability and strength compared to traditional concrete, have been conducted for this purpose by many researchers. Geopolymer concrete (GPC) has been developed as a possible new construction material for replacing conventional concrete, offering a clean technological choice for long-term growth. Over the last few decades, geopolymer concrete has been investigated as a feasible green construction material that can reduce CO2 emissions because it uses industrial wastes as raw materials. GPC has proven effective for structural applications due to its workability and analogical strength compared to standard cement concrete. This review article discusses the engineering properties and microstructure of GPC and shows its merits in construction applications with some guidelines and suggestions recommended for both the academic community and the industrial sector. This literature review also demonstrates that the mechanical properties of GPC are comparable and even sometimes better than those of PC concrete. Moreover, the microstructure of GPC is significantly different from that of PC concrete microstructure and can be affected by many factors. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={In this study, the effect of waste glass on the mechanical properties of concrete was examined by conducting a series of compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and flexural strength tests. According to this aim, waste glass powder (WGP) was first used as a partial replacement for cement and six different ratios of WGP were utilized in concrete production: 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50%. To examine the combined effect of different ratios of WGP on concrete performance, mixed samples (10%, 20%, 30%) were then prepared by replacing cement, and fine and coarse aggregates with both WGP and crashed glass particles. Workability and slump values of concrete produced with different amounts of waste glass were determined on the fresh state of concrete, and these properties were compared with those of plain concrete. For the hardened concrete, 150 mm × 150 mm × 150 mm cubic specimens and cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 100 mm and a height of 200 mm were tested to identify the compressive strength and splitting tensile strength of the concrete produced with waste glass. Next, a three-point bending test was carried out on samples with dimensions of 100 × 100 × 400 mm, and a span length of 300 mm to obtain the flexure behavior of different mixtures. According to the results obtained, a 20% substitution of WGP as cement can be considered the optimum dose. On the other hand, for concrete produced with combined WGP and crashed glass particles, mechanical properties increased up to a certain limit and then decreased owing to poor workability. Thus, 10% can be considered the optimum replacement level, as combined waste glass shows considerably higher strength and better workability properties. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was performed to investigate the microstructure of the composition. Good adhesion was observed between the waste glass and cementitious concrete. Lastly, practical empirical equations have been developed to determine the compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and flexure strength of concrete with different amounts of waste glass. Instead of conducting an experiment, these strength values of the concrete produced with glass powder can be easily estimated at the design stage with the help of proposed expressions. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Tall buildings with irregular shapes and considerable heights are gaining popularity in creating the vertical cities around the world. They also considered one of the major energy consumers with little regards to sustainability. Tall building is wind-sensitive structure and shape plays major role in determining wind loads, which usually govern the design of its lateral resisting system. Thus, evaluating wind loads properly and designing an optimal lateral system accordingly are the main challenges attributed to the design process of irregular tall building. This paper presents a computational procedure for the optimal design of wind-resistant irregular tall building to minimize the total weight of structure within design requirements in single digital environment. That is achieved firstly by creating a digital system of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis that is coupled with pressure-load translation (PLT) algorithm to evaluate the wind motions on irregular tall buildings and generate the design wind loads accordingly. Genetic Algorithm (GA) with enhance design constrains function of lateral displacements, inter-story drifts and top acceleration is then developed to perform structural optimization. A numerical example using 70-story twisting reinforced concrete building is implemented to verify the feasibility of the developed computational procedures. Steady and incompressible flow applied at ((Formula presented.)) angle of attack was implemented in the CFD model to simulate the wind flow on the studied building. Genetic algorithm with improved design constraints of static and dynamic design requirements was developed to optimize the structure effectively and efficiently. The numerical example demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving 35.71% reduction of concrete volume from the original lateral structural system design. This is also translated into a sustainability value by lessening the embedded carbon dioxide by 4,400 tons. Copyright © 2022 Alkhatib, Kasim, Qaidi, Najm and Sabri Sabri.},

abstract={Cement manufacturing emits a lot of CO2, which adds to negative environmental effects, including global warming and climate change. These phenomena have reignited interest in using a range of industrial waste products to make geopolymer composites and alkali activated binders, with the goal of reducing the use of regular Portland cement in building construction. One of these toxic radioactive waste substances is red mud (RM), which is produced as a byproduct of Bayer's aluminium (Al) production process. The objective of this study is to undertake a state-of-the-art review of the literature on the usage of red mud and fly ash (FA) in the production of red mud-fly ash geopolymer composites (RM-FAGPC). The environmental and economic implications, physical and chemical characteristics, manufacturing, distribution, categorization, and prospective uses of red mud are all discussed. Furthermore, current advances in the use of red mud and FA for geopolymer synthesis in terms of physical, mechanical, durability, and microstructure characteristics are highlighted. Furthermore, this research aims to design a path toward a realistic valorisation that considers both actual and perceived problems, including leaching, radioactivity, and the life cycle evaluation of red mud geopolymer composites (RM-GPC). The potential usage of RM-FAGPC manufacturing highlights the need for more research into the combination and proportion of these two raw materials with other cement-based materials, which might lead to novel, cost-effective, and energy-saving construction processes and products. It is also suggested that investigative efforts be focused on ecological, economic, and life cycle analyses. © 2022},

abstract={Geopolymer (GP) concrete is a novel construction material that can be used in place of traditional Portland cement (PC) concrete to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and effectively manage industrial waste. Fly ash (FA) has long been utilized as a key constituent in GPs, and GP technology provides an environmentally benign alternative to FA utilization. As a result, a thorough examination of GP concrete manufactured using FA as a precursor (FA-GP concrete) and employed as a replacement for conventional concrete has become crucial. According to the findings of current investigations, FA-GP concrete has equal or superior mechanical and physical characteristics compared to PC concrete. This article reviews the clean production, mix design, compressive strength (CS), and microstructure (Ms) analyses of the FA-GP concrete to collect and publish the most recent information and data on FA-GP concrete. In addition, this paper shall attempt to develop a comprehensive database based on the previous research study that expounds on the impact of substantial aspects such as physio-chemical characteristics of precursors, mixes, curing, additives, and chemical activation on the CS of FA-GP concrete. The purpose of this work is to give viewers a greater knowledge of the consequences and uses of using FA as a precursor to making effective GP concrete. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={In order to predict the compressive strength (σc) of Ultra-high performance fiber reinforced concrete (UHPFRC), developing a reliable and precise technique based on all main concrete components is a cost-effective and time-consuming process. To predict the UHPFRC compressive strength, four different soft computing techniques were developed, including the nonlinear- relationship (NLR), pure quadratic, M5P-tree (M5P), and artificial neural network (ANN) models. Thus, 274 data were collected from previous studies and analyzed to evaluate the effect of 11 variables that impact the compressive strength, including curing temperature. The performance of the predicted models was evaluated using several statistical assessment tools. According to the findings, ANN results performed more suitable than other models with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and highest coefficient of determination (R2) value. According to the sensitivity analysis, the most variables that affect the compressive strength prediction of UHPFRC are a curing temperature with a percentage of 17.36%, the fiber content of 17.13%, and curing time of 15.13%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Shear walls have high strength and stiffness, which could be used at the same time to resist large horizontal loads and weight loads, making them pretty beneficial in several structural engineering applications. The shear walls could be included with openings, such as doors and windows, for relevant functional requirements. In the current study, a building of G + 13 stories with RC shear walls with and without openings has been investigated using ETABS Software. The seismic analysis is carried out for the determination of parameters like shear forces, drift, base shear, and story displacement for numerous models. The regular and staggered openings of the shear wall have been considered variables in the models. The dynamic analysis is carried out with the help of ETABS software. It has been observed that shear walls without openings models perform better than other models, and this is in agreement with the previous studies published in this area. This investigation also shows that the seismic behaviour of the shear wall with regular openings provides a close result to the shear wall with staggered openings. At the roof, the displacement of the model with regular openings was 38.99 mm and approximately 39.163 mm for the model with staggered openings. However, the model without a shear wall experienced a displacement of about 56 mm at the roof. Generally, it can be concluded that the openings have a substantial effect on the seismic behaviour of the shear wall, and that should be taken into consideration during the construction design. However, the type of opening (regular or staggered) has a slight effect on the behaviour of shear walls. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The safe disposal of an enormous amount of waste glass (WG) in several countries has become a severe environmental issue. In contrast, concrete production consumes a large amount of natural resources and contributes to environmental greenhouse gas emissions. It is widely known that many kinds of waste may be utilized rather than raw materials in the field of construction materials. However, for the wide use of waste in building construction, it is necessary to ensure that the characteristics of the resulting building materials are appropriate. Recycled glass waste is one of the most attractive waste materials that can be used to create sustainable concrete compounds. Therefore, researchers focus on the production of concrete and cement mortar by utilizing waste glass as an aggregate or as a pozzolanic material. In this article, the literature discussing the use of recycled glass waste in concrete as a partial or complete replacement for aggregates has been reviewed by focusing on the effect of recycled glass waste on the fresh and mechanical properties of concrete. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={According to the authors’ best information, the majority of research focuses on other waste materials, such as recycling industrial waste (glass, silica fume, marble and waste foundry sand), etc. However, some researchers suggest dune sand as an alternative material for concrete production, but knowledge is still scarce. Therefore, a comprehensive review is required on dune sand to evaluate its current progress as well as its effects on the strength and durability properties of concrete. The review presents detailed literature on dune sand in concrete. The important characteristics of concrete such as slump, compressive, flexural, cracking behaviors, density, water absorption and sulfate resistance were considered for analysis. Results indicate that dune sand can be used in concrete up to 40% without any negative effect on strength and durability. The negative impact of dune sand on strength and durability was due to poor grading and fineness, which restricts the complete (100%) substation of dune sand. Furthermore, a decrease in flowability was observed. Finally, the review highlights the research gap for future studies. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The manufacture of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) produces a lot of CO2 in the atmosphere. Researchers have recently focused on exploring the behaviour of geopolymer concrete (GPC) as an alternative to Portland cement concrete (PCC) in micro and macro dimensions. Geopolymers (GP) are innovative cement-based materials that could totally replace OPC composites. Geopolymer composites (GC) have a reduced carbon footprint and utilize less energy than OPC. The construction industry's main concerns are material characteristics and the performance of reinforced concrete (RC) structural components. Therefore, this review paper is going to look at some important material properties, like fresh characteristics, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, flexural strength, and modulus of elasticity, as well as the evidence of the structural behaviour of GPC beams. According to the findings of this review, GPC offers similar or superior fresh and mechanical properties to conventional concrete composite. In addition, it was mentioned that GPC might be utilized to design GPC members securely in terms of their strength capabilities and standard codes of practice. Nevertheless, further study is suggested to include more detailed and cost-effective design methods for the potential use of GPC for large-scale field applications. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The construction sector has been addressing the issue of integrating sustainability into production processes over the last few years, either through solid waste materials as aggregates in concrete or the search for more eco-friendly raw materials. Besides, the global trends group focused on developing an alternative to cement, which is a significant contributor to pollution of the environment due to its greenhouse gas emissions. Geopolymer (GP) is one of the most acceptable solutions for utilizing all industrial by-products containing an alumino-silicate (A-S) source material. However, one method to recycle waste rubber tires is incorporating them into geopolymer concrete (GPC) as an alternative to natural aggregates. Recently, the potential of combining the advantages of GPC with rubberized concrete to produce rubberized geopolymer concrete (Ru-GPC) as a viable, sustainable building material has been recognized. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of the waste rubber's environmental and economic impact, resources, recycling, classifications, and physicochemical properties. Besides, this article provides in-depth studies on the behaviors and properties of Ru-GPC composites, such as their basic components, preparation and curing processes, fresh and physical properties, mechanical properties, dynamic properties, durability properties, microstructures, and insulation properties. The effect of crumb rubber (CRu) substitution on critical properties is addressed critically. Also, it highlights the applications, embodied CO2 emissions, and cost analysis of Ru-GPC. Moreover, gaps in the literature and recommendations for future study have been identified to support further developments in the investigation and future publication of Ru- GPC materials in practice. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={The mining industry produces a large amount of stone waste and tailings, which poses a threat to the environment. Dumping is the most common means of disposing of this industrial waste, contributing to soil degradation and water pollution with the acquisition of valuable land. Fortunately, it can be recycled in a variety of technologies, including the promising geopolymerization technology, which turns waste into value. This review paper presents recent advances in the production of mine tailings-based geopolymer composites from industrial waste as a potential sustainable building material. This article also provides in-depth studies on the behaviors and characteristics of mine tailings composites utilized in geopolymer production, such as physical properties, mechanical properties, durability properties, microstructural properties, thermal properties, leaching behavior, and potential applications. Besides, study developments are moving towards a comprehensive understanding of the environmental footprints and economic benefits of mine tailings-based geopolymer composites for building applications utilizing mine tailings as suitable concrete material. This review paper also highlights knowledge gaps that must be overcome to progress mine tailings composites for geopolymers, as well as future study opportunities based on prior research and existing challenges. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.},

abstract={A main global challenge is finding an alternative material for cement, which is a major source of pollution to the environment because it emits greenhouse gases. Investigators play a significant role in global waste disposal by developing appropriate methods for its effective utilization. Geopolymers are one of the best options for reusing all industrial wastes containing aluminosilicate and the best alternative materials for concrete applications. Waste wood ash (WWA) is used with other waste materials in geopolymer production and is found in pulp and paper, wood-burning industrial facilities, and wood-fired plants. On the other hand, the WWA manufacturing industry necessitates the acquisition of large tracts of land in rural areas, while some industries use incinerators to burn wood waste, which contributes to air pollution, a significant environmental problem. This review paper offers a comprehensive review of the current utilization of WWA with the partial replacement with other mineral materials, such as fly ash, as a base for geopolymer concrete and mortar production. A review of the usage of waste wood ash in the construction sector is offered, and development tendencies are assessed about mechanical, durability, and microstructural characteristics. The impacts of waste wood ash as a pozzolanic base for eco-concreting usages are summarized. According to the findings, incorporating WWA into concrete is useful to sustainable progress and waste reduction as the WWA mostly behaves as a filler in filling action and moderate amounts of WWA offer a fairly higher compressive strength to concrete. A detail study on the source of WWA on concrete mineralogy and properties must be performed to fill the potential research gap. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper reports the results of a study conducted to examine the impacts of adding graphene oxide (GO) to GBFS-fly ash-based geopolymer concrete. The geopolymer concrete’s compressive strength, thermal conductivity, and modulus of elasticity were assessed. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to understand the differences in mineralogical composition and a rapid chloride penetration test (RCPT) to investigate the changes in the permeability of chloride ions imposed by GO addition. The results showed that adding 0.25 wt.% GO increases the modulus of elasticity and compressive strength of GBFS-FA concrete by 30.5% and 37.5%, respectively. In contrast, permeability to chloride ions was reduced by 35.3% relative to the GO-free counterparts. Thermal conductivity was decreased as GO dosage increased, with a maximum reduction of 33% being observed in FA65-G35 wt.% samples. Additionally, XRD showed the suitability of graphene oxide in geopolymer concrete. The present research demonstrates very promising features of GO-modified concrete that exhibit improved strength development and durability compared to traditional concrete, thus further advocating for the wider utilization of geopolymer concrete manufactured from industrial byproducts. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={In the last few decades, the concrete industry has been massively expanded with the adoption of various kinds of binding materials. As a substitute to cement and in an effort to relieve ecofriendly difficulties linked with cement creation, the utilization of industrial waste as cementitious material can sharply reduce the amount of trash disposed of in lakes and landfills. With respect to the mechanical properties, durability and thermal behavior, ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) delineates a rational way to develop sustainable cement and concrete. Apart from environmental benefits, the replacement of cement by GGBS illustrates an adequate way to mitigate the economic impact. Although many researchers concentrate on utilizing GGBS in concrete production, knowledge is scattered, and additional research is needed to better understand relationships among a wide spectrum of key questions and to more accurately determine these preliminary findings. This work aims to shed some light on the scientific literature focusing on the use and effectiveness of GGBS as an alternative to cement. First and foremost, basic information on GGBS manufacturing and its physical, chemical and hydraulic activity and heat of hydration are thoroughly discussed. In a following step, fresh concrete properties, such as flowability and mechanical strength, are examined. Furthermore, the durability of concrete, such as density, permeability, acid resistance, carbonation depth and dry shrinkage, are also reviewed and interpreted. It can be deduced that the chemical structure of GGBS is parallel to that of cement, as it shows the creditability of being partially integrated and overall suggests an alternative to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). On the basis of such adjustments, the mechanical strength of concrete with GGBS has shown an increase, to a certain degree; however, the flowability of concrete has been reduced. In addition, the durability of concrete containing GGBS cement is shown to be superior. The optimum percentage of GGBS is an essential aspect of better performance. Previous studies have suggested different optimum percentages of GGBS varying from 10 to 20%, depending on the source of GGBS, concrete mix design and particle size of GGBS. Finally, the review also presents some basic process improvement tips for future generations to use GGBS in concrete. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={In recent decades, several studies have considered the use of plastic waste as a partial substitute for aggregate in green concrete. Such concrete has been limited to non-structural applications due to its low strength. This raises whether such concrete can be enhanced for use in some structural applications. This paper reports an attempt to develop a structural-grade concrete containing plastic waste aggregate with high proportions of substitution and confined with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) fabrics. Experimental research was conducted involving the casting and testing 54 plain and confined concrete cylinders. A concrete mixture was designed in which the fine aggregate was partially replaced by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste plastic at ratios of 0%, 25%, and 50%, and with different w/c ratios of 0.40, 0.45, and 0.55. The results show that confinement has a substantial positive effect on the compressive behavior of PET concrete. The enhancement efficiency increases by 8–190%, with higher enhancement levels for higher substitution ratios. Adding one layer of CFRP fabric raises the ultimate strength of samples that have lost compressive strength to a level close to that of unconfined samples not containing PET. This confinement is accompanied by an increase in the slope of the stress-strain curve and greater axial and lateral strain values at failure. For the specimens confined by CFRP fabric, PET aggregate can be used as a partial substitute for sand at a replacement ratio of up to 50% by volume for structural applications. This paper also considers the ability of existing models to predict the strength of confined-PET concrete circular cross-sections by comparing model predictions with experimental results. The strength of confined PET concrete elements can’t be accurately predicted by any of the models that are already out there. It’s important to come up with a new model for these elements. © 2022 Qaidi et al.

abstract={Plastics have become an essential part of our daily lives, and global plastic production has increased dramatically in the past 50 years. This has significantly increased the amount of plastic garbage produced. Researchers have recently been interested in using trash and recyclable plastics in concrete as an ecologically acceptable building material. A large number of publications have been published that describe the behavior of concrete, containing waste and recovered plastic com ponents. However, information is scattered, and no one knows how plastic trash behaves as concrete materials. This research examines the use of plastic waste (PW) as aggregate or fiber in cement mortar and concrete manufacturing. The article reviewed the three most significant features of concrete: fresh properties, mechanical strength, and durability. PW and cement connections were also studied using microstructure analysis (scan electronic microscopy). The results showed that PW, as a fiber, enhanced mechanical performance, but PW, as a coarse aggregate, impaired concrete performance owing to poor bonding. The assessment also identified research needs in order to enhance the performance of PW-based concrete in the future. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={During the transition of one material from macro- to nano-range size, considerable changes occur in the electron conductivity, optical absorption, mechanical properties, chemical reacting activity, and surface morphology. These changes can be advantageous in the production of new mixture composites. Due to the need for developing improved infrastructure, new and high-performance materials should also be developed. In this regard, to improve the performance of concrete mixtures, several methods have been investigated, including using nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance various characteristics of the concrete composite like improving fresh and mechanical properties of self-compacting concrete (SCC) as well as improving permeability and absorption capacity of the composite by providing extremely fine particles to fill micro-pores and voids. In this paper, a state-of-the-art review was carried out on the influence of various NPs inclusion on the fresh, mechanical, and durability properties of self-compacting mortars (SCM). So that current and most recent studies previously published were investigated to highlight the influences of different NPs on the slump flow diameter, V-funnel flow time, compression and flexural strengths, water absorption, chloride penetration, and electrical resistivity. Moreover, the main section of this study was devoted to proposing different models, including nonlinear model (NLR), multi-logistic model (MLR), and artificial neural network (ANN), to predict the compressive strength (CS) of SCMs modified with NPs. Based on the analyzed data, it was illustrated that the addition of NPs into SCMs significantly enhances the fresh, mechanical, and durability performance of SCMs. Moreover, the microstructure of SCMs was considerably improved due to the higher specific surface area of NPs and their reaction with undesirable C–H which present in the cement paste matrix to produce additional C-S-H gel. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={Since nanotechnology can enhance the performance of materials, significant effort has been expended in recent years to incorporate nanoparticles (NPs) into geopolymer concrete (GPC) to improve performance and produce GPC with improved characteristics. Recent efforts have been made to incorporate various nanomaterials, most notably nano-silica (nS), into GPC to improve the composite's properties. Compressive strength (CS) is an important property of all concrete composites, including geopolymer concrete. Several mix proportion parameters and curing temperature and ages influence the CS of geopolymer concrete. As a result, developing a credible model for forecasting concrete CS is critical for saving time, energy, and money while also providing guidance for scheduling the construction process and removing formworks. This paper consists of three phases; in the first phase, a detailed review on the effect of adding nS on the CS of GPC was provided; then, in the second phase, a large amount of mixed design data were extracted from literature studies to create five different models including artificial neural network, M5P-tree, linear regression, nonlinear regression, and multi logistic regression models for forecasting the CS of GPC incorporated nS. Finally, the developed models were validated in the last phase by carrying out experimental laboratory works. Results revealed that the addition of nS improves the CS of GPC, and the ANN model estimated the CS of GPC incorporated nS more accurately than the other models. On the other hand, the alkaline solution to binder ratio, molarity, NaOH content, curing temperature, and ages were those parameters that significantly influenced the CS of GPC incorporated nS. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The production of cement results in the emission of much carbon dioxide, which contributes to ‎ ‎undesirable environmental impacts such as climate change and global warming. These ‎phenomena ‎have rekindled interest in utilizing a variety of industrial waste products to ‎produce geopolymer ‎‎(GP) composites and alkali-activated (AA) binders in order to reduce the ‎usage of ordinary ‎Portland cement in building construction. Waste red mud (RM), also known as bauxite residue, is one of these ‎hazardous radioactive ‎waste materials that is formed as a by-product of Bayer's aluminum ‎manufacturing process. This ‎paper conducts a systematic review of the literature on the use of ‎RM and slag in the production ‎of red mud-slag geopolymer (RM-SGP). An overview of the ‎economic and environmental ‎impacts, physical and chemical properties, production, ‎distribution, classification, and potential applications ‎of RM are presented. ‎Besides, recent advancements in the usage of RM and slag for geopolymer ‎production are ‎described in terms of physical, mechanical, durability, and microstructure ‎ properties. Moreover, this ‎study attempts to chart a route toward a realistic valorization that ‎reflects both real and perceived ‎concerns, such as radioactivity, leaching, and the life cycle ‎assessment of red mud geopolymer (RM-GP). The potential ‎use of RM-SGP production indicates the need for further studies into ‎the mixture proportion ‎and combination of these two raw ingredients with other cementitious materials ‎leading to new ‎energy-saving and affordable building products and processes. Also, it is ‎recommended that ‎research efforts be directed ‎toward economic, life cycle, and environmental ‎assessments.‎ © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={The mining sector generates a considerable amount of waste stone and tailings, which constitute a ‎‎substantial hazard to the ecology. The most prevalent method of disposing of these industrial ‎‎wastes is by dumping, which adds to soil deterioration and water contamination and also takes up ‎‎valuable land. Fortunately, it can be recycled in a variety of ways, including the promising ‎‎geopolymerisation technique, which converts waste into value. This article discusses recent ‎‎advances in the production of mine tailings-based geopolymers composites (MT-GPC) from waste and ‎‎industrial by-products as a potentially sustainable construction material. Besides, focusing on the ‎‎following ‎‎aspects: economic and production perspective; environmental consequences and waste ‎‎disposal; physical and chemical properties; mechanical properties; durability properties; ‎‎microstructure properties‎; thermal properties; and potential applications of MT-GPC.‎ © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={The use of nano clay to improve the qualities of construction materials and engineering applications has attracted a lot of discussion in recent years. This review article summarizes the influence of nano clay as a cement substitute and supplement on the performance of conventional and high-performance concrete. The addition of nano clay to high performance concrete revealed an increase in compressive and flexural strength, as well as durability attributes such as resistance to elevated temperatures and sulfate attack, while simultaneously decreasing porosity, permeability, and water absorption. This enhancement is a result of nano clay's roles as nano reinforcements, nanofillers, nucleation sites, and reactive pozzolans, which promote hydration and increase material characteristics. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Recycling glass waste for developing sustainable cementitious mortar and concrete have recently attracted increasing attentions for the construction industry. From another aspect, the nitrate-based environment due to chemical fertilizers has a significant effect on reinforced concrete and normal concrete by producing damages like its microstructure, corrosion of reinforcement. The major goal of this research work is to study the effect of Ammonium Nitrate (NH4NO3) on the unite weight and strength of glass mortar by performing experimental tests. In this article, eco-friendly mortar containing recycled glass powder (GP), as a replacement to cement, is submerged in NH4NO3 solutions. In total, 60 cement mortar mixtures were proportioned in this research work used GP passing sieves 200 µm. NH4NO3 solutions with 5, 10, and 20% concentration, and three different exposure periods 10, 30, and 60 days were applied. The experimental results showed that the effect of NH4NO3 on the density of mortar containing GP is less critical than that of conventional mortar. After 60 days of immersion in the solution with a concentration of 20% NH4NO3, the reduction in density of glassy mortar is less than that of ordinary mortar. Furthermore, the results indicated that the maximum compressive strength was attained at 10% replacement level of cement with GP by approximately 60 MPa after 60 days of immersion in NH4NO3 solution. © 2022},

abstract={Waste polypropylene is one of the most common non-biodegradable solid wastes generated by industrial activity in Iraq. Solid waste is one of the several causes having a negative effect on the environment. The issues arise as a result of factors such as the difficulty of recycling waste and restricted reuse. Polypropylene is a significant kind of solid waste that has a negative impact on the environment. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of using polypropylene as a partial replacement for sand in concrete. This material's effect on the fresh, mechanical, and thermal conductivity properties of concrete was investigated. Six concrete mixtures using polypropylene as a partial substitute for sand were produced at substitution percentages of 0%, 8%, 16%, 24%, 32%, and 40%. The slump, fresh and dry unit weight, compressive strength, and thermal conductivity properties of fresh and hardened concrete were determined. At various rates of concrete production, the results of the experiments demonstrated a decrease in unit weight and compressive strength. Thermal conductivity reduced 49.1% for the mix contained 40% of waste polypropylene and satisfied the lower limit strength for structural purposes. © 2022},

abstract={The building industry, which emits a significant quantity of greenhouse gases, is under tremendous pressure due to global climate change and its consequences for communities. Given the environmental issues associated with cement production, geopolymer concrete has emerged as a sustainable construction material. Geopolymer concrete is an eco-friendly construction material that uses industrial or agricultural by-product ashes as the principal binder instead of Portland cement. Fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, rice husk ash, metakaolin, and palm oil fuel ash were all employed as binders in geopolymer concrete, with fly ash being the most frequent. The most important engineering property for all types of concrete composites, including geopolymer concrete, is the compressive strength. It is influenced by different parameters such as the chemical composition of the binder materials, alkaline liquid to binder ratio, extra water content, superplasticizers dosages, binder content, fine and coarse aggregate content, sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate content, the ratio of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, the concentration of sodium hydroxide (molarity), curing temperature, curing durations inside oven, and specimen ages. In order to demonstrate the effects of these varied parameters on the compressive strength of the fly ash-based geopolymer concrete, a comprehensive dataset of 800 samples was gathered and analyzed. According to the findings, the curing temperature, sodium silicate content, and alkaline solution to binder ratio are the most significant independent parameters influencing the compressive strength of the fly ash-based geopolymer concrete (FA-BGPC) composites. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Industrial waste has been rapidly increased day by day because of the fast-growing population which results environmental pollutions. It has been recommended that the disposal of industrial waste would be greatly reduced if it could be incorporated in concrete production. In cement concrete technology, there are many possibilities to use waste materials either as cement replacement or aggregate in concrete production. Two major industrials waste are glass and marble waste. The basic objective of this investigation is to examine the characteristics of concrete waste glass (WG) as binding material in proportions 10%, 20% and 30% by weight of cement. Furthermore, to obtain high strength concrete, waste marble in proportion of 40%, 50% and 60% by weight cement as fine aggregate were used as a filler material to fill the voids between concrete ingredients. Fresh properties were evaluated through slump cone test while mechanical performance was evaluated through compressive strength and split tensile strength which were performed after 7 days, 28 days and 56 days curing. Results show that, workability of concrete decreased with incorporation of waste glass and marble waste. Furthermore, mechanical performance improved considerably up 20% and 50% substitution of waste glass and waste marble respectively. Statistical approach of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used optimize both waste materials in concrete. Results indicate better agreement between statistical and experimental results. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={The disposal of waste rubber tires has become a main ecological issue around the world. Each year, millions of tires are disposed of, buried, or thrown away, which is a severe hazard for the environment due to its prolonged degrading period. Therefore, recycling waste rubber as aggregates as a supplemental construction material is beneficial. The usage of crumbs rubber (CR) would be led to sustainable utilization of waste material, which would preserve depleting natural aggregate sources and protecting the environment. This paper reviews the published research on the performance of concrete containing CR as eco-friendly aggregates. Moreover, it highlights the impact in terms of aggregate substitution content, form, size, and waste treatment on the fresh and mechanical properties of crumb rubber concrete (CRC). The paper also aims to update the database for further experimental and numerical research on rubberized concrete. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},
